** DONE different first character rotation for worms
** TODO move "map" (with position of worms with worm_id) into separate module

** update screen size (h/w) during execution (currently doesn't track it)

* After Features
** github CI/CD pipeline
** need tests
- [X] test VerticalWorm
- [X] decouple drawing Matrix from calculations
- [ ] test matrix calculation layer
** need benchmarks

* Optimizations
** clamp coordinates to make sure they fit the screen
** update crossterm
** SPEED_RANGE as interval type
